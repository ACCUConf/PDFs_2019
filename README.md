# ACCU 2019 PDFs

This repository contains all the PDFs offered for inclusion on the [ACCU Conference
website](https://conference.accu.org) website associated with the ACCU 2019 conference.

After each ACCU conference, PDFs of session material are collected to be associated with the videos on the
[ACCU Conference channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw/), and linked
to from that year's [schedule page](https://conference.accu.org/2018/schedule.html) of the conference website.

This repository is separate from the website repository to avoid the problems of that repository getting
huge and unwieldy due to these "blobs".

## Naming Strategy

This repository uses a PDF file naming strategy _presenter\_name\_-\_session\_title_.pdf avoiding all spaces by replacing
spaces with underscores. For many presenter sessions list all presenters separated with double
underscore. So for example:

only\_presenter\_name\_-\_title\_of\_the\_session.pdf

presenter\_one\_name\_\_presenter\_two\_name\_-\_title\_of\_this\_two\_person\_session.pdf

## Licence and Copyright

Copyright in the material of each PDF file remains with the author or authors of the file. There is no
general licence associated with the files in this repository, nor is the material in the public domain by
virtue of being in this repository.
